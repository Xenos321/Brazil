              <h2>Brazil’s Beating Heart</h2>
              <p>Soccer isn’t just a sport in Brazil—it’s a way of life. Brazil holds the record for most FIFA World Cup titles (5) and is known worldwide for its beautiful, skillful, and creative playing style. From beach kickabouts to packed stadiums, football pulses through every corner of Brazilian culture. Soccer was introduced in the late 1800s by British immigrants and quickly caught on. What made it explode in popularity was its accessibility—all you needed was a ball and a bit of space. Over time, it became the sport of the people, played everywhere from favelas to professional clubs. By the 1950s and 60s, with legends like Pelé leading Brazil to World Cup glory, the country cemented itself as the world’s football capital.</p>
